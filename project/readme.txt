This program uses Python 3.5 or above. **Version 2.7 should print verbose mode differently, but will still work!

***How to Run Compiler:
1. Insert code into codeHere.txt
2. Edit compiler.py, line 23 to say
    os.system('python parser.py')
    ** INSIDE the quotes is the command line to run parser.py
    ** I am not sure why it only runs like this and not when I import it
    ** I will find a solution in near future
3. Run compiler.py


***Not yet implemented:
AST, Symbol tree, and scope/type checking will only run on the first program currently.
I am working to resolve this issue, not sure why it's happening.

***Yes, I now hate python too.
